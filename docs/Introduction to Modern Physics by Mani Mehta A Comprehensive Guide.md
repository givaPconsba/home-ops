## Chapter 1: Relativity
 
The first chapter of Introduction to Modern Physics by Mani Mehta introduces the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time. The chapter begins by reviewing the concepts of frames of reference, Galilean transformations, and the principle of relativity. It then explains the postulates of special relativity and derives the Lorentz transformations, which relate the measurements of different observers moving at constant velocities. The chapter also discusses the consequences of special relativity, such as time dilation, length contraction, mass-energy equivalence, and relativistic momentum and energy.
 
The second part of the chapter deals with general relativity, which extends the theory of relativity to include gravity and accelerated motion. The chapter explains the equivalence principle, which states that gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable, and introduces the concept of curved spacetime, which describes how gravity affects the geometry of space and time. The chapter also covers some of the predictions and tests of general relativity, such as gravitational redshift, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and black holes.
 
The chapter concludes with a summary of the main points and a list of key terms. It also provides several exercises and solutions that help students apply and reinforce their knowledge of relativity.
